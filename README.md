# Bacterial Genome Reconstruction

This is the source code for a web tool that identifies bacterial genomes & optimizes read-lengths.

It is divided as such:
 - `/bacterial-genome-reconstruction`: CLI scripts exposed as nodejs functions in a neat package
 - `/server`: the back-end (nodejs+express)
 - `/client`: the front-end (react)
